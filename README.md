Brain AI - Self-Learning AI Companion
Welcome to Brain AI, a personalized AI companion that adapts and learns from user interactions. This project integrates voice interaction, sentiment analysis, reminders, and a Q-learning-based self-learning component. Brain AI is designed to become your personal assistant, learning your preferences, moods, and habits over time.

Features
Voice Input and Response: Interact with Brain AI using your voice.
Self-Learning with Q-Learning: The AI improves its responses based on previous interactions.
Personalized Experience: Tracks user preferences, mood, and profile information.
Reminder System: Set reminders and receive notifications.
Real-Time Emotion Visualization: Observe Brain AI’s emotional states in real-time.
OpenAI GPT Integration: Generate advanced responses using OpenAI’s GPT model.

Project Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+: Download and install from python.org.
OpenAI API Key: Sign up and get your API key from OpenAI.
OpenWeather API Key: Sign up for an API key at OpenWeather.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/brain-ai-project.git
cd brain-ai-project
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install openai matplotlib cryptography SpeechRecognition gtts playsound requests
Set Up API Keys:

Run the application. A GUI will prompt you to enter your OpenAI API key. OpenWeather API key should be set within the code as self.weather_api_key in the Brain class.
Usage
Starting the AI
Run the Program:

bash
Copy code
python brain_ai.py
Enter OpenAI API Key:

Enter your OpenAI API key in the GUI prompt and click Start.
Interacting with Brain AI:

Voice Interaction: Speak commands like:
"What’s the weather in [city]?" – Get weather info.
"Who created you?" – Brain AI will reveal its creator as "Arka".
"Remind me to [task]" – Set a reminder.
"My name is [name]" – Personalize your AI experience.
Text-Based Commands: You can also type commands if you’re testing without voice input.
Emotional Visualization:

A real-time matplotlib window will display Brain AI’s emotional states based on interactions.
Stopping the AI
Say “Exit” or close the terminal to stop the program.
Tips and Tricks
1. Enhance Personalization
Use commands like “My favorite color is blue” to add more personal details.
Brain AI stores your name and preferences and adapts responses based on them.
2. Improve AI Responses Over Time
As Brain AI learns through reinforcement, repeat positive interactions (like correct weather queries) to boost accuracy.
3. Experiment with Q-Learning Settings
Adjust learning_rate and discount_factor in the Brain class to fine-tune how quickly the AI learns.
4. Check Reminders and Logs
Reminders: Check for reminders set during your session.
Logs: Open brain_activity.log to view detailed logs of interactions and emotional changes.
5. Explore Additional APIs
Add custom integrations like news updates or to-do lists to enhance Brain AI’s functionality.
