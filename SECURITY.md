1. Purpose
This security policy establishes guidelines to handle and report security vulnerabilities related to the Brain AI project. We aim to provide a safe and secure environment for users by addressing vulnerabilities promptly.

2. Scope
This policy applies to:

Vulnerabilities in the Brain AI codebase.
Exposed sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords).
Security best practices for contributors and maintainers.
3. Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

3.1 Disclosure Process
Do not publicly disclose any vulnerabilities.
Report the vulnerability by emailing us directly with the subject line “Security Vulnerability in Brain AI Project”.
3.2 Information to Include
Please include the following details in your report:

Detailed description of the vulnerability.
Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
Potential impact on users and data.
Any recommended fixes or patches.
3.3 Confidentiality
All reports will be handled confidentially. We request that you do not publicly share details of the vulnerability until it has been fully resolved.

4. Handling Sensitive Information
4.1 API Keys and Secrets
Never commit API keys, secrets, or passwords directly to the repository.
Use environment variables to store sensitive information locally.
For OpenAI API and other service keys, follow best practices to manage and protect access.
4.2 Encryption
Encrypt sensitive data when applicable (e.g., using libraries like cryptography for API key storage).
Avoid storing sensitive data in plaintext, even in environment variables.
5. Security Best Practices for Contributors
5.1 Code Contributions
Ensure your code does not introduce new vulnerabilities, such as:
Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command injection, etc.)
Insecure API usage.
Avoid committing hard-coded sensitive information. Instead, use environment variables or encrypted storage mechanisms.
5.2 Dependency Management
Run a dependency vulnerability scan (e.g., pip-audit) before pushing code to check for vulnerable libraries.
Promptly update dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
5.3 Review Process
Security-related code changes must be reviewed by at least one other contributor before merging into the main branch.
6. Security Updates and Notification
We will issue a security update and notification through GitHub releases and security advisories for:

Any significant vulnerabilities or data breaches.
Critical updates or changes to the security practices within this repository.
7. Response and Remediation Timeline
Initial Acknowledgment: Within 48 hours of receiving a vulnerability report.
Investigation and Analysis: Within 5 business days, we will evaluate the reported vulnerability.
Resolution and Patch Release: Based on the severity, we aim to provide a resolution within 10 business days.
8. Contact Information
For any security-related inquiries, please contact us.
